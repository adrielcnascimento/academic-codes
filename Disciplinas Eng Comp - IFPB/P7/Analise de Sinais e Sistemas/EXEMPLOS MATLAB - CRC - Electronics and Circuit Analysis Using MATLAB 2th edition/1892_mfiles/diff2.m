%  Solution of second-order differential equation
% The function diff2(x,y) is created to evaluate the diff. equation
%  the name of the m-file is diff2.m
%  the function is defined as:
%
function xdot = diff2(t,x)
is = 2;
c = 50e-6;  L = 1/32;  r = 10;
k1 = 1/c ;   %  1/C 
k2 =  1/L ;   %  1/L  
k3 = 1/(r*c);   % 1/RC
%xdot(1) = k2*x(2);
%xdot(2) = k1*is - k1*x(1) - k3*x(2);
xdot = [0 k2; -k1 -k3]*[x] + [0; k1*is];
